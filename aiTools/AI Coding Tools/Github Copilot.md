# GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot, developed by GitHub in collaboration with OpenAI, is an AI-powered code completion tool that revolutionizes software development by acting as an intelligent pair programmer. Launched in 2021 and continually refined through updates, it integrates directly into popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, and Neovim, assisting developers by suggesting code snippets, entire functions, and even test cases in real time. Aimed at both novice and seasoned programmers, Copilot enhances productivity, reduces boilerplate coding, and supports over a dozen programming languages, making it a staple in modern development workflows.
